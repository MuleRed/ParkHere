# ParkHere
Park Here is a Android and Web App that creates simple a cloud-based parking system. Similar to Airbnb, ParkHere allows people
to create their own parking lots which users can pay for a timed spot. Instead of relying on getting physical tickets, ParkHere
identifies by user's license plates. Parking lots are organized by the number of spots available, approximation to the user,
and cost per hour. In the future we hope to be able to expand our userbase to included exisitng parking decks and street parking.

Technologies Utilized: Android SDK and Django
